{"name":"PostgreSQL Dashboard","tagline":"A real-time monitoring screen based on Dashing and Sinatra ","body":"\r\nPostgreSQL Dashboard is simple monitoring tool that provides a live activity report of a PostgreSQL instance.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daamien/pgDashboard/master/public/pgdashboard.screenshot2.png)\r\n\r\nIt is designed to be displayed on a large screen in a monitoring room or an open space office.\r\nThe current dashboard is currently composed of 5 widgets :\r\n\r\n* **General Info** : Version, number of host databases, etc. \r\n* **Hit Ratio** : The % of data found in cache\r\n* **Buffers** : The number of new buffers allocated\r\n* **Queries** : The number of active queries currently running of the instance\r\n* **Twitter** : A glimpse of the #PostgreSQL feed\r\n\r\nAdding a new job should be fairly easy. this tool is design so that you can write a custom widget to display stats you find relevant or build a dynamic graph on some \"business logic\" valuation.\r\n\r\nThe layout is also entirely flexible. You can easily drag'n'drop any widget to put it wherever you want on the screen. And HTML code of the dashboard can be modified for specific needs, such as specific screen dimensions.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nIf you already have installed a Ruby environnement, simply type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/daamien/pgDashboard.git\r\n  cd pgDashboard\r\n  bundle\r\n  mv config_postgresql.rb.example config_postgresql.rb\r\n  vi config_postgresql.rb\r\n  dashing start\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow go to [http://localhost:3030]() and have fun!\r\n\r\nFor more instructions, please read [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/daamien/pgDashboard/blob/master/INSTALL.md)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL Dashboard is based on Dashing, a very nice dashboard framework.\r\nDashing itself is based on Sinatra, a very nice Ruby web framework.\r\n\r\nBasically to run this tool, you will need:\r\n \r\n* PostgreSQL 9.0.x or later\r\n* Ruby 1.9.x or later\r\n* Sinatara 1.4.x or later\r\n* Dashing 1.3.x or later\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\n__You need to be careful about the security of your PostgreSQL server when installing this tool .__\r\n\r\nTherefore I **strongly** recommend the following precautions :\r\n\r\n* [Read the Great PostgreSQL Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)\r\n* Check your ``pg_hba.conf`` file\r\n* Do not allow users to access PostgreSQL Dashboard from the Internet\r\n* Do not use a superuser in the config_postgresql.rb file\r\n\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\nPostgreSQL Dashboard is distributed under the PostgreSQL License.\r\n\r\nDashing is distributed under the MIT License.\r\n\r\nThe name \"PostgreSQL\" is registered trademark and the PostgreSQL Logo is a copyrighted design of the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n  * Check out the [Dashing documentation](http://shopify.github.com/dashing) for more information.\r\n","google":"UA-3389140-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
