You can easily drag'n'drop any widget to put wherever you want on the screen. You can also edit the dashboard HTML code to adapt it to wide screens.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\nIf you already have installed a Ruby environnement, simply type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/daamien/pgDashboard.git && cd pgDashboard\r\n  bundle\r\n  mv config_postgresql.rb.example config_postgresql.rb && vi config_postgresql.rb\r\n  dashing start\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow go to [http://localhost:3030]() and have fun!\r\n\r\nFor more instructions, please read [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/daamien/pgDashboard/blob/master/INSTALL.md)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL Dashboard is based on Dashing, a very nice dashboard framework.\r\nDashing itself is based on Sinatra, a very nice Ruby web framework.\r\n\r\nBasically to run this tool, you will need:\r\n \r\n* PostgreSQL 9.0.x or later\r\n* Ruby 1.9.x or later\r\n* Sinatara 1.4.x or later\r\n* Dashing 1.3.x or later\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\n__You need to be careful about the security of your PostgreSQL server when installing this tool .__\r\n\r\nIf you don't protect your communications, an attacker placed between the dashboard and PostgreSQL could gain access to your database server.\r\n\r\nTherefore I **strongly** recommend the following precautions :\r\n\r\n* [Read the Great PostgreSQL Documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)\r\n* Check your ``pg_hba.conf`` file\r\n* Do not allow users to access PostgreSQL Dashboard from the Internet\r\n* Do not use a superuser in the config_postgresql.rb file\r\n\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\nPostgreSQL Dashboard is distributed under the PostgreSQL License.\r\n\r\nDashing is distributed under the MIT License.\r\n\r\nThe name \"PostgreSQL\" is registered trademark and the PostgreSQL Logo is a copyrighted design of the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n  * Check out the [Dashing documentation](http://shopify.github.com/dashing) for more information.\r\n","google":"UA-3389140-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
