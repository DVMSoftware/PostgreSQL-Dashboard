PostgreSQL 8.4 is obsolete since July 2014
============================================

Before doing anything else, you should consider upgrading to a supported version.

See : http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/

PostgreSQL Dashboard is not design to work with PostgreSQL 8.4 ! This compatibity functions are provided "AS IS" 

It may or may not work. We won't take time to test it. We won't fix bugs related to PostgreSQL 8.4

Again you should really consider upgrading to a supported version.
